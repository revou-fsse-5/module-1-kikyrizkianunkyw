## About The Code
This project consists of an HTML structure for a coffee shop website, including a sticky navigation header, a welcoming section, a showcase of local top choices, a user preference form, an about us section, and a contact form. The accompanying CSS ensures a responsive design optimized for tablets and smartphones. Media queries adjust the layout for better readability on smaller screens, hide the .img1 element on smartphones, and maintain a user-friendly grid layout across various devices. The use of flexbox and grid layout techniques ensures that the content remains visually appealing and accessible, regardless of the screen size.

Hello, my name is Kiky Rizkianunky Woluwo, known as Kiky. I was born in 2000. I am from Makassar and graduated from Universitas Hasanuddin Makassar. I like coffee; I used to prefer robusta beans, but now I think I prefer arabica beans. Thank you.
